# GenericPHPProject
Hello,
This project was originally created by Collin Switzer, Austin Barger, Prince Brooks, and Jake Rice for their CIS 411 Project.
The goal of this project was to convert an old MS Works database into a .csv that could then be used for storing data in a MySQL database via phpMyAdmin.
This version has generic information for customer data to show for public viewing

Technolgies used include:
- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript
  - Bootstrap
  - JQuery
    - Datatables
  - AJAX
- PHP
  - Dyanamically generated content
  - Security
    - Password - salt & hashing
- MySQL
    - Convertion of formatted .csv file into useable and meaningful data while also removing irrelevant outliers
- phpMyAdmin
  - Interface for backend
  
All of these technologies were used to create a GUI based website that allows for the creation, modification, and deletion of customer entities and products, new job sites,
and new machinery that would be used by the client to conduct daily business.

Website uses an MVC approach
